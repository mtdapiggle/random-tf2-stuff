# session 1:
first thing i wanted to model was demoman's stock stickybomb, but the mainnn problem is that i hvae no idea how to do the spikes on the outside.

a stickybomb looks like this, i could maybe use circular pattern in some weird, wacky way to do it, but i'm not entirely sure since i have to somehow sketch on a curved surface, which onshape doesn't like doing (you can't sketch on a curved surface at all.)
i'm just gonna start off with a sphere. 
also, in the image, i realised that the sticky bomb sort of has rings, meaning that i may have to segment the stickybomb, and make sure that you can assemble it together without using anything other than the pieces. 
i thought of using boolean to somehow separate it, but i don't think it works now.

that kinda? works, so imma have to do this like a trillion times to get all of the layers.

wuhhhhhhh..
so i realised one slight problem with my current design, the band in the middle is uh... not in two parts. 
oh wait i realised i can mirror things. 
i also have to adjust some extrudes because i didn't account for another band near the middle.

this might work. 
so i realised that the stickybomb has a slight flare on the first bands near the middle, and the top is slightly flat.

just a littttleee off the top.

surely this works out well. (it probably won't)

oh shoot.

thought chamfer would work (it doesn't)

surely nobody notices. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d4c7c4-cb46-4206-8bde-99ef3024adbe)
eh good enough. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/183bb1e2-bf13-497f-a3f9-714d2181459c)
okie dokie that works. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e58c0f16-a726-414b-bd1c-9e75bc818ba8)
now that i look at it, i kinda feel like the flare is a bit too much.

vs
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ddb4b9-699f-460d-8d08-8f0e5a614134)
(they're so impercetibly different, that it doesn't matter)
also, i just got some of my frc cad stuff checked by bartosz, and he said to put .stl file commits, so i'm gonna do that 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14b823af-6a08-4ac1-8405-6517eb348e31)
i do have a small feeling that the middle band is a bit too small, so i might expand that out (leading to more adjustments...)
